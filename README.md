# BetterAutoMessages

This plugin allows you to send messages on the server set in the config.yml file at the specified time interval, specified in the same file. The plugin sends messages even when you are not on the server! If you found any error, write to me on [discord](https://discord.com/): profkrzys

You can also join my [minecraft server](http://profmc.pl/)!
